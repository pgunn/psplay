psplay aims to be a perfect splayer

Splaying (also known as jittering) is, for a whole bunch of hosts that run a
job, the adjustment of their timing for that job so they don't all perform it
at the same time, usually in order to prevent them from ganging up on some
resource and exhausting it. An ideal splay usually would arrange their launching
of those jobs so the distance between them across the cluster is maximised.

psplay is a bit of code that runs on a client and a server that aims to
implement this, knowing that occasionally hosts are added or removed from that
list that runs the job; it attempts to do the right thing in such circumstances.

Note that multiple jobs can share the same "splay" key and have an offset from
it; this can be used to enforce a sequence (although any mechanisms to track
job failures or dependencies are out-of-scope for this tool).
